# Animal Image Classifier

## Overview

This project aims to build a deep learning model using PyTorch to classify images of animals. The model takes image inputs and predicts the class of the animal present in the image. Additionally, an API has been created using FastAPI to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the model.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khoido2003/Animal-Classification-BE.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

     ```bash
   cd animal-image-classifier
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation can be found in the `data/` directory. It contains images of various animals along with their corresponding labels.

## Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by the need for an accurate and efficient animal image classifier. We would like to acknowledge the creators of PyTorch and FastAPI for providing the tools necessary to build this project.
